Welcome to my new site!. The goal of this blog is to talk about web development by way of example. I also started this project because I hadn't touched my site in over three years and I wanted to have an excuse to try out React/Flux and ES6/Babel. The entire source code of this site is [publicly hosted on github](https://github.com/emuvente/joshuakp.com), and many of the posts will be about building this blog.

I've already completed a good portion of the initial work and there will be follow-up posts covering those topics. So far, the posts I have planned are as follows:

- Node.js blogging with Poet & React
- Isomorphic React
- Getting started with ES6/Babel
- Using Livereload & Nodemon with Gulp for seamless development
- Automatic syntax highlighting
- Best practices for Responsive Progressive Enhancement

I'm realizing now that this may be a bit ambitious, but nothing ventured, nothing gained!
