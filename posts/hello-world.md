This is the first post in the blog. The goal of this blog is to be an ongoing project to showcase various tech-y things.
I wanted to do these things:

- ES6/Babel
- Isomorphic React/Flux
- Responsive Progressive Enhancement

To achieve this I'm using starting with this [post](http://engineering.devmag.io/post/1/creating-an-isomorphic-blogging-app-using-react-and-flux) and several tools:

- Poet
- Atom
- Markdown
- Heroku
- Stylus

And I have plans to do these things:

- Prism
- Cloudinary
- CDN (Cloudflare?)
